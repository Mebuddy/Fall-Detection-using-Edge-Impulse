Create an account in edge impulse and open commannd prompt on your device.
Upload a basic code of MPU6050 into microcontroller(This guide helps in esp32/esp32-cam).
Based on the time delay set in the code, the frequency will change during the data collection process.
The base code for MPU6050 will be attached to this.
Open Powershell/Cmd Prompt(Powershell works better)
Install edge impulse using the prompt from the website
Then type "edge-impulse-data-forwarder --clean", This command is used to create a new library where all the data is stored.
Connect the device to your computer and select the COM port that's connected to 
Give it a name and start the recording process
Head to the edge impulse website and you will see your device there
Give it a name for the training dataset, and start recording the data.
Once the data is created it can be sent through various mathematical equations to get the required.
