# Edge_Impulse

This directory contains resources and code related to integrating Edge Impulse with the Fall Detection project.

## Overview

Edge Impulse is an embedded machine learning platform that enables you to build and deploy machine learning models on edge devices. In this project, it is used for detecting falls via sensor data, such as from accelerometers or gyroscopes, and deploying the trained model to a microcontroller or embedded system.

## Structure

- **Model files**: Exported machine learning models from Edge Impulse.
- **Deployment code**: Scripts or code snippets to run the model on supported hardware.
- **Sensor integration**: Example code to collect data from sensors and pass it to the model for inference.
- **Testing and evaluation**: Scripts and data for validating the performance of the deployed model.

## Getting Started

### 1. Data Collection

1. Connect your sensor (e.g., accelerometer) to your device.
2. Use Edge Impulse tools or provided scripts to collect motion/fall data.
3. Upload and label data in your Edge Impulse project.

### 2. Model Training

- Use the Edge Impulse Studio to:
  - Design signal processing and learning blocks.
  - Train a fall detection model on your dataset.

### 3. Model Deployment

- Export the trained model as C++ code, library, or binary, depending on your device.
- Place the exported model files in this directory.
- Use the provided deployment scripts or instructions to flash/run the model on your device.

### 4. Running Inference

- Use the sample code to read sensor data and pass it to the deployed model.
- Monitor the output for fall detection events.

## Prerequisites

- Edge Impulse account ([https://edgeimpulse.com/](https://edgeimpulse.com/))
- Supported hardware (e.g., Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense, Raspberry Pi, etc.)
- Required drivers and dependencies for your hardware.

## Example Usage

```cpp
// Pseudocode for running inference
#include "edge-impulse-model.h"
#include "sensor.h"

void loop() {
    float input_buffer[EI_INPUT_SIZE];
    read_sensor_data(input_buffer);
    ei_impulse_result_t result = run_inference(input_buffer);
    if (result.fall_detected) {
        alert_fall();
    }
}
```
